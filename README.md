# youtubeDown
A quick and dirty downloader for youtube

# Requirements
Python 3.x and `requests`

    pip install requests

# Note
Youtube changed their format in April 2019, since that, it doesn't work... Licensed videos(like Music) still didn't download after upgrading this. Check `youtube-dl` for that which is more sophisticated that this.
